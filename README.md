# BarterSystemSkillSwapManagement
SkillSwap is a unique skill-sharing platform built on the barter system, where users can learn new skills by either purchasing access to skill-based content or trading their own skills with others. Instead of relying solely on money, users can offer what they know in exchange for what they want to learn.
